I am a Librarian with 13 years of experience in Information Technology including six years specializing in Academic Libraries.

I am passionate about increasing knowledge of STEM through education and hands on experience. As a computer science graduate, I want to increase the number of woman and girls in STEM fields.

I am interested in Digital Preservation and Digital Scholarship concepts such as Open Access, Institutional Repositories, Research Data Management, Records Management, Archives, and Digital Forensics.
